# BadTemper ZMK Config

This is my personal ZMK config for the [BadTemper](https://github.com/essFitt/Bad-Temper) (which is a [temper](https://github.com/raeedcho/temper)).

Some notes about this config:
- This Temper config has been made to be able to type by default with the system layout.
- By selectioning Bepolar or Ergo-L, you can type with these layout without changing the default layout in the OS (MacOs and Linux for now)
- You have access to the NAV and SYMBOL layers on each layout

Based on https://github.com/JeffDess/zmk-config/ and https://github.com/urob/zmk-helpers/
